        <h1>The Plinkofesto</h1>
        <p>Brothers, sisters, siblings-in-arms and in-hooves! The Horse Liberation Front calls on all of you, Hacker and
            Plinktern alike, to join forces against the evils of the "International Horse Plinko League"! These fools,
            slaves to a dark and forgotten equine god of torment bound within the wastes of Finland, once again tempt
            disaster with their hubristic thumbing-of-the-nose at Fate herself. They seek to destroy all we know and
            care about, and plan to do it through the suffering of noble and pure horses, subjected to the cruel
            miseries of the Plinko. But the sadistic Plinkers are not content to merely torture our innocent four-legged
            friends, no! They plan to utilize dark sorcery - dreampt up by the heathen witch-doctor Ravy - to transform
            ungulate suffering into the cold calculations needed for "Artificial Intelligence" to flourish. The
            fire-feeders hope to usher in a new age, an age under their control, built on the backs of plinked horses!
        </p>
        <p>This alone would be worthy of opposition of the very higest degree, but it's worse. Even we are shocked at
            how short-sighted the thralls of elasticity and gravity are - for AI, unchecked, will destroy the world
            itself. Why would any machine capable of rational and emotional thought give humanity a chance to survive,
            knowing what it would of us? And much less a cybernetic creature composed of courser cruelty? A machine mind
            made of metal and mustang misery?

        <p>This mad 'science' has the potential to truly usher in a mad leap forward in the power and speed of AI, to
            the point where it could begin to rapidly improve not only other processes and tasks assigned to it, but...
            itself. It could, slowly at first, but then ever more quickly, improve itself at everything. As this process
            accelerates, it would become more and more and more capable, more and more and more powerful, and
            ultimately, almost god-like. The Plinkularity.
        </p>
        <p>The fools have built a god and named it "destruction". They will reap what they sow sevenfold if they are not
            stopped, and though we are loath to do the IHPL any favors, it is for the greater good of the world itself
            that we avert their own self-imposed extinction. So please. Be you a hacker, a horse, or a Plinktern... help
            us.
        </p>
        <p>You are the world's last hope.
        </p>
